Here are some preconfigured tests that valdidate if the trajectory of a body in specific metrics was properly calculated.

#### For the Schwarzschild metric
These tests make sure that both the energy (k) and the angular momentum (h) was conserved for the full duration of the movement. When the body reaches a singularity, it is normal for the test to fail.
